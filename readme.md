## Interface
Interface is a blueprint for your class that can be used to implement a class ( abstract or not)

## Abstract class
  Abstract classes are a bit different from interfaces. These are also used to create blueprints for concrete classes but abstract classes may have implemented methods. But to qualify as an abstract class, it must have at least one abstract method. Abstract classes can implement one or more interfaces and can extend one abstract class at most.
